Bio
======
I'm a <a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/">WASP</a> Ph.D. student at the <a href="https://www.kth.se/is/dcs/division-of-decision-and-control-systems-1.788078"> Division of Decision and Control Systems (DCS)</a> of <a href="https://kth.se">KTH Royal Institute of Technology</a> under the supervision of Prof.
<a href="https://people.kth.se/~kallej/">Karl Henrik Johansson</a> and Prof. <a href="https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/bauer-stefan">Stefan Bauer</a>.
I completed my master's degree in Computer Engineering (Artificial Intelligence and Robotics) at the University of Tehran. During my master's studies, I was a research assistant at Data Analytics Lab under the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~bahrak">Behnam Bahrak</a>.

Research Interests
======
My research interests include causal inference, representation learning, and generative models. In particular, I'm interested in understanding high-level representations of different data modalities in a way that closely aligns with human perception, and I find object-centric representations as a promising direction for this purpose. I'm also interested in understanding the underlying causal structure of real-world systems and I hope that someday we can achieve this for complex systems such as human brain.
